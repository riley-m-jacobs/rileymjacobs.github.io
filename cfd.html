                        Throughout the course of ASE 382 Q, we covered a wide range of concepts related to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which provided us with a solid foundation for understanding numerical simulation and analyzing fluid flow problems. These concepts included numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, discretization schemes, time integration techniques, and the principles of stability and accuracy. Through various assignments, we had the opportunity to apply these concepts in practical settings and gained experience implementing matlab codes for classical CFD test cases. The culmination of our learning experience was building our own CFD solver, which allowed us to see firsthand how these concepts are put into practice. Overall, this course has equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle complex fluid flow problems and to make informed decisions when using CFD software tools and/or implementing my own CFD solver.<br></br> My particular final term project investigates the effects of ramp angles and varying supersonic mach numbers for a compression ramp, particularly with respect to its treatment of oblique shocks. The study employs a numerical approach utilizing the finite volume method, with Godunov's method and Roe's approximate Riemann solver, as well as HLLE and HLLE+ schemes to approximate the numerical fluxes (superposition of Riemann problems) to solve the 2-D non-linear compressible, inviscid Euler equations. Then the results will be compared to analytical, experimental and other numerical data available in literature.

			Over the past century, the ramp compression problem has been extensively studied through experimental, analytical, and numerical methods, owing to its simple geometry and easily defined boundary conditions. When a supersonic flow encounters an inclined surface, it changes direction to meet the solid boundary condition, resulting in flow compression and the formation of an oblique shock. This phenomenon is commonly observed in ramp-like or wedge-like structures, and for this project, I will consider a rectangular channel with a significantly larger depth than height, allowing for the flow to be modeled as two-dimensional. The objective of this project is to solve the steady, inviscid and compressible Navier-Stokes equations for this flow over a rectangular domain with varying ramp sizes. Figure 1, illustrates the geometry of the problem, including the necessary boundary conditions to achieve a steady-state solution. All flows investigated in this project will be supersonic, with the entrance to the domain considered as uniform flow velocity. <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> Timeline          Goal<br></br>03/12-03/18          Perform additional literature review, project setup and create mesh<br></br>03/19-03/25          Begin developing solver and work on understanding FV methods<br></br>03/25-04/01          Continue to debug and generate initial results<br></br>04/02-04/08          Post processing of the results and perform stability and convergence analysis<br></br>04/09-04/15          Produce an outline and first draft of written report<br></br>04/16-04/22          Finalize all written report details and figures<br></br>05/01                Turn in final report

			A refined mesh was generated in Matlab to simulate the flow over a ramp, which is commonly found on high-speed vehicle surfaces or inlets to engines. The mesh was divided into three major regions: pre-shock, ramp, and post-shock. The mesh refinement process was carried out to ensure that the mesh is accurately refined for visualizing and analyzing the development of the oblique shock at the base of the ramp. Prior to the mesh refinement process, preliminary sketches were undertaken to identify the overarching dimensions, geometry of the ramp and early development of the logic pertaining to node placement and control volumes. The beginnnings of a mesh and the "rough" sketches are shown below.

			The first refinement was to reduce the number of cells in the pre-shock region (as the flow will remain uniform) while increasing the number of cells in the post-shock region. This will provide the required resolution to capture the post-shock behavior as the shock bounces of the top and bottom walls. Additionally, to capture the rapid changes in flow properties closer to the wall, a scaling or "stretching" has been applied in the y-direction, creating a greater number of cells closer to the wall. Additionally, to further refine the mesh domain, each square control volume has been divided into two triangular control volumes. This process resulted in the mesh shown below.

			A convergence study was conducted to evaluate the effect of increasing the number of control volumes on the simulation results. It was observed that as the number of control volumes increased, the flow became clearer and finer details became easier to see. This can be attributed to the fact that a higher number of control volumes allows for a more accurate discretization of the flow domain and a better resolution of the flow features. The convergence study demonstrated that increasing the number of control volumes significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Therefore, it is recommended to use a sufficiently large number of control volumes to ensure that the flow characteristics are captured accurately and the simulation results are reliable.

			The literature review highlights that most compressible Euler equation solvers use structured grids to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the finite volume method. In this method, the advective terms are solved using the popular Godunov-type (upwind) method, where the inter-cell numerical fluxes are calculated by solving the Riemann problems using reconstructed values of the primitive variables at the cell interfaces. It has been found that finite volume schemes are better than flux splitting approaches due to their superior resolution of discontinuities. Thus, I have chosen to implement the superior finite volume method to simulate my ramp compression problem. <br></br> In his 1959 paper, Godunov outlined his first order finite volume method. Godunov observed that at each cell interface the numerical flux can be described as a Riemann problem. This means that the Riemann problem at every time can be solved explicitly in terms of waves, emanating from each interface. This form is the standard form of a finite volume scheme and can be solved explicitly for the scalar euler conservation laws. In order to use the Godunov scheme, I will begin by replacing the exact solutions of the Riemann problem with two approximate Riemann solvers. The first linearized solver is Roe. Roe solves the nonlinear equations by linearizing them. In order to improve Roe, Harten's entropy fix was also implemented. This particular linearized solver fails at resolving rarefractions, but as my particular problem consists of a single wave traveling to the right (or to the left depending on the sign of A), the Roe scheme should be sufficient to capture the shock phenomena present in the problem. <br></br> I will additionally implement the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Einfeldt (HLLE) as well as HLLE+ flux function method as it is rather simple and efficient. This particular scheme keeps only the largest and smallest characteristics, averages intermediate states in-between. As proposed by Park and Kwan, the wave speed estimates from the HLLE scheme with the velocity estimate from Roe's scheme can form the HLLE+ flux function numerical scheme. Additional constraints such as the CFL condition as well as slope limiters will be investigated to help ensure numerical stability and accuracy especially around high density changes like the shocks.

			The boundary conditions for the velocity field are relatively straightforward. There are three kinds of boundaries to be defined in this problem: inlet, exit, and the wall or a solid wall boundary. The inlet will ensure a uniform velocity in the x-direction, while the top and bottom boundaries will be set to zero to ensure that the no-slip and no-through boundary conditions are satisfied. This is accounted by the assigning the nodes along the top and bottom boundaries as no flow through. Mathematically and numerically this is imposed by n_x*u = n_y*v = 0. Unlike incompressible flow, there is no need to solve Poisson's equation for pressure, but we only need to account for pressure using the state equation. In summary, the "wind tunnel" will contain a uniform flow in the x-direction with density $\rho = 1$, pressure $P = 1.4$, and will be investigated at both Mach 2 and 3.
